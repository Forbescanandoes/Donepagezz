    questions: [
      {
        question: "What is an MD System?",
        answer: "DonePagez uses simple Markdown (MD) files clean text files that store the knowledge AI needs to understand your project. One file might define your audience. Another your product. Another your brand voice. The system part comes from stacking dozens of MD files together like building the blueprint of a house, piece by piece so when you feed them into Cursor, the AI knows exactly how to build your landing page properly. No confusion. No randomness. Just full context, ready to launch."
      },
      {
        question: "How does DonePagez work?",
        answer: "Pick your SaaS idea. Create a new project in DonePagez. Expand your idea using chaining prompts. Fill out your Audience, Product, and Branding MDs. Inject the MDs into Cursor for full context. Build your landing page with AI help. Export and deploy on Vercel. Launch and own your brand."
      },
      {
        question: "I just started with Cursor. Can I use DonePagez?",
        answer: "Yes. DonePagez was built assuming you are starting fresh. Our video guides walk you through every step, from simple idea to full AI powered landing page."
      },
      {
        question: "What makes DonePagez better than trying to build a landing page on my own?",
        answer: "DonePagez gives you a full proven system structured MD files, chaining prompts, a clean codebase, and a guided process. No guess work. No messy copy paste. Just a clean expansion from idea to pro level launch."
